## Project Overview

Heart disease is a significant health concern, and early detection plays a crucial role in effective treatment and prevention. In this project, we developed a machine learning model that analyzes patient data to predict the risk of heart disease. By utilizing a diverse dataset containing features such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and exercise habits, we trained and evaluated our model to achieve accurate predictions.

## Data Collection

We collected a comprehensive dataset from various reliable sources, including medical research databases and healthcare institutions. The dataset encompasses a wide range of patient information, including both categorical and numerical features. Rigorous data cleaning and preprocessing techniques were applied to ensure data quality and consistency.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is a critical step in building an accurate machine learning model. We conducted an in-depth analysis of the dataset, identifying relevant features and transforming them to extract meaningful insights. Feature scaling, one-hot encoding, and other techniques were employed to prepare the data for training the models effectively.

## Model Training and Evaluation

We experimented with multiple machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, and Random Forests, to determine the most effective model for heart disease prediction. We split the dataset into training and testing sets and performed cross-validation to assess the models' performance. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to measure and compare the models' effectiveness.

## Web Application

To make our heart disease prediction model accessible and user-friendly, we developed a web application using Streamlit, a Python library for creating interactive web interfaces. The web application allows users to input their relevant health information and obtain a prediction of their risk of heart disease. The application provides clear and interpretable results, empowering individuals to take proactive steps towards their cardiovascular health.
